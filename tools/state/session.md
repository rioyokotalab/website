task: T-147 Run all documented model/effort/task cells
status: in-progress

## Now
- User authorized an eight-hour adaptive campaign ending
  2026-07-14T05:08+0900. Execute T-147--T-153 continuously, dynamically
  checkpointing task blocks, selection decisions, and routing evidence.
- Frozen round: baseline `c4b0720`, run label `gpt56-full-20260713`, full
  prompt/default inspection/runner-lite/P2P, deterministic task-blocked order.
- Resumable single-writer orchestrator committed as `579d66f`; dry runs prove
  75 documented and 12 remaining ultra cells with automatic switching.
- WBD-003 documented block complete: 15/15 capability passes; 14 scored 100,
  Sol/xhigh scored 89 from failed `denied-default`. Provisional Pareto routes:
  Terra/low fastest at 25,045 ms total; Sol/low lowest effective tokens at
  8,298. Do not select until ultra and matched repeats are available.
- Integrity checkpoint: 18 total runs/artifacts/metric pointers, no errors;
  metrics contain 18 v2 rows. Next frozen block: WBD-001 documented (15 cells).

## Working set
